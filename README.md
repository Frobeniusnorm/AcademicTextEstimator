# AcademicalPaperEstimator
Project for linguistic pragmatics seminar.
A program which uses Corpora data (in this repository a sample of the COCA word frequency list) to rate a given text on how academical it is by its vocabulary.

# Corpora Source
The used samples from the COCA corpus can be found at https://www.wordfrequency.info/. Huge thank you for providing that information.
