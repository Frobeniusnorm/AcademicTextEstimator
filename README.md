# AcademicalPaperEstimator
Project for linguistic pragmatics seminar.
A program which uses Corpora data (in this repository a sample of the COCA word frequency list) to rate a given text on how academical it is by its vocabulary.
### Use
You need Java 8 or higher installed on your computer. Then you can either build the project or just use the precompiled jars (coming soon).
### Building
You need the Scala Compiler and sbt. Then just clone the project and execute "sbt run".
### Corpora Source
The used samples from the COCA corpus can be found at https://www.wordfrequency.info/. Huge thank you for providing that information.
